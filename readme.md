# Karax

**Karax** is as a versatile web application framework written in Nim.

- **Dual Compilation**: Seamlessly compiles to both JS and native backends, empowering developers to deploy on either frontend or backend platforms.
  - Client-side experiences with `Single Page Apps` (SPAs).
  - Leverage `Server Side Rendering` (SSR) for conventional web applications.
  - Deploy static sites with `Static Site Generation` (SSG), ideal for blogs, documentation, and more.

- **Innovative Features**: Karax uses a virtual DOM similar to react React, complemented by an event-reactivity system reminiscent of Elm.
- **minimal dependency tree**: By keeping its dependency list short, Karax ensures a smoother, clutter-free development journey.
