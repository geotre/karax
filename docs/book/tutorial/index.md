## Tutorial

In this tutorial we will walk through a step by step example building a web application with Karax.

If you'd prefer a shorter introduction, you can check out the [quickstart](quickstart.md) guide.

The application we will build is a simple package directory, similar to [Nimble directory](https://nimble.directory/). It will be a client-side SPA with the following features:
* Loading packages from a JSON file
* Searching packages by name
* Filtering packages by tag
* Favoriting packages

<!--
Ideally the tutorial will demonstrate:
  Usage of the buildHtml macro
  Some basic routing
  Usage of Kajax
  Usage of vstyles
  jjson/jdict/jseq
-->
